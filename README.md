# quizzing-software
This software was made by me as a part of a school fest which tests the competitors on the basis of a static questionnaire and produces the result as mentioned in instructions.
Developed entirely in Visual Studio, this was one of my initial projects (which explains the static questionnaire XD). 

The instructions are as follows:

GENERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS

ROUND 1 : crack me if you can!!  [ ELIMINATION ROUND ]
1.	A  set of 14 questions will be given.
2.	Points allotment : +4 for correct answer and -2 for incorrect answer.
3.	Time duration for this round is 10 minutes.
4.	Participants are required to submit their mobile phones during the competition.
5.	Top six candidates will be selected for the next round i.e. “final round” 
6.       The results once announced will be final and irrevocable.
7.       Any unauthorized activity i.e one which you are not instructed to perform 
          will immediately lead to disqualification.

GENERAL RULES REGARDING USAGE OF THE SOFTWARE

1.	On starting the quiz, you will be provided with a timer whose location
          you can set according to your convenience.
2.	Once the timer ends, you will not be able to answer any questions.
3.	You can freely toggle between questions while giving the quiz.
4.	You can use the reset button if you have to uncheck an option.

          CANNOT unattempt a question. i.e if you do not want to attempt a question
          or plan to attempt it later, DONOT press the submit button, use the Question
          Navigator instead.

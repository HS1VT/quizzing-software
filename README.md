# quizzing-software
This software was made by me as a part of a school fest which tests the competitors on the basis of a static questionnaire and produces the result as mentioned in instructions.
Developed entirely in Visual Studio, this was one of my initial projects (which explains the static questionnaire XD). 

Following are the screenshots:
